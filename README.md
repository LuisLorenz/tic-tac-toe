# pseudocode
- ok: board 
- ok: orientation board

- input("Make a move: ") 
    - while valide_user_input == False: 
        - empty place -> True 
        - not in range -> False
        - not empty -> False 

- ok: check if player has won 

- defining player
    - assigning X or O to a player 
    - ask user if he wants to play as X or O
